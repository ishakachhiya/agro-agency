In particular, the value of crops, livestock, and poultry production posted increments. Meanwhile, the value of fisheries production dropped during the period. (Table 2a and Figure 1)

Crops, which accounted for 53.9 percent of the total value of production in agriculture and fisheries, went up by 1.8 percent. Increases in the value of palay and corn production were recorded at 1.0 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. (Tables 2a, 2b, and 3a)

Livestock, which shared 15.6 percent to the total value of production in agriculture and fisheries, increased by 4.0 percent. The value of hog production grew by 4.5 percent. (Tables 2a, 2c, and 3a)
